# eBay Sell APIs (CoMa ERP / Orders Hub)

Integrates eBay seller APIs into the embedded ERP via Orders Hub: import paid orders into `sales_order`, push finished-goods price and quantity to existing offers, and surface Analytics / Account diagnostics.

**Hardware / account status:** implemented from eBay OpenAPI contracts (Fulfillment, Account, Analytics) and the Inventory API reference for `bulkUpdatePriceQuantity`. **Not yet validated against a real eBay sandbox or production seller account.**

UI lives under Orders Hub: `/erp/orders-hub/ebay` (legacy `/erp/ebay` still works; overview at `/erp/orders-hub`).

## What it does

| Direction | Behavior |
|---|---|
| eBay to CoMa | Pull paid/checkout-complete orders via Fulfillment `GET /sell/fulfillment/v1/order` with `lastmodifieddate` watermark |
| CoMa to eBay | Update price and quantity on **existing** offers only (`POST /sell/inventory/v1/bulk_update_price_quantity`). Does not create or publish listings |
| Analytics | Read traffic report and seller standards; Account `privilege` as connection probe |

## Hybrid order posting

1. Each eBay line item upserts into `ebay_order` / `ebay_order_line` keyed by `line_item_id` (unique).
2. SKU resolution: `ebay_listing.ebay_sku` first, else exact match on `item.sku`.
3. If `auto_post` is enabled, the SKU is mapped, and `fin_good` stock covers the qty: create `sales_order` + negative `stock_move` with `idem_key = ebay-line-{line_item_id}-sale`, status `auto_posted`.
4. Otherwise the line stays `pending` for the operator at `/erp/ebay` (confirm, confirm with shortage, or dismiss).
5. Re-importing the same order never double-fires stock or sales: status check inside the transaction + unique `idem_key`.

This path never touches `parts.completed_qty`.

## Credentials

Stored in `ebay_credential` (single row, id=1). **Excluded from Settings JSON backup** so secrets do not land in export files. After a restore, paste credentials again (or use env vars).

| Source | Keys |
|---|---|
| Env (wins over DB) | `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN`, optional `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT`, `EBAY_MARKETPLACE_ID` |
| DB / UI | Same fields via `PUT /api/erp/ebay/credentials` (API returns masked values only) |

OAuth uses `grant_type=refresh_token` against the Identity token endpoint. Paste a user refresh token from the eBay developer portal (sandbox first). There is no RuName callback flow in this release.

### How to get your keys (operator guide)

Also available in the UI as **How to get your API keys** on the eBay page. Official portal: [eBay Developer Program (My Keys)](https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys).

1. Sign in at developer.ebay.com with the seller account you want to connect.
2. Create an application keyset (Sandbox first, then Production). Copy App ID (Client ID) and Cert ID (Client Secret).
3. Open User Tokens (OAuth) for that keyset, select the Sell scopes below, complete consent, and copy the refresh token.
4. Paste Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh token into CoMa, match sandbox/production, save, then Test connection.

Recommended scopes (space-separated):

- `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment.readonly`
- `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory`
- `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.account.readonly`
- `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.analytics.readonly`

## Inventory push

- Quantity: `SUM(stock_move.qty)` for the mapped item in `fin_good` (same source as ERP sales stock checks).
- Price: `bomCostForItem` + `pricingNumbers` (applies `MARGIN_DEF`, `ADDS_PCT`, `EBAY_FEE` / per-item overrides).
- One SKU per API call; up to 25 offer IDs per call (comma-separated `offer_id` on the mapping row).
- `offer_id` is required on the mapping; without it the push records an error and skips.

## Background runner

`server/ebay/runner.js` starts with Express (`ebayRunner.start(db)`). Interval is 5 minutes. Skips when `DEMO_MODE=true` or credentials are missing. Repeated failures raise an in-memory notification (not a toast storm).

## UI

Route `/erp/orders-hub/ebay` (sidebar: Sales / Orders Hub). Connection status, key guide, masked credentials form, SKU mappings, pending queue, recent orders, analytics JSON panels.

## Module layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `server/ebay/schema.js` | CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS |
| `server/ebay/credentials.js` | Env/DB resolution + masking |
| `server/ebay/client.js` | Token cache, axios, backoff |
| `server/ebay/orders.js` | Import + hybrid apply |
| `server/ebay/inventory.js` | Listings CRUD + push |
| `server/ebay/analytics.js` | Traffic / standards / privilege |
| `server/ebay/runner.js` | Periodic sync |
| `server/ebay/index.js` | Express factory mounted at `/api/erp/ebay` |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Test connection fails | Sandbox vs production environment, refresh token for that environment, scopes on the app |
| Orders never appear | Fulfillment only returns checkout-complete orders; sandbox purchases must be marked paid |
| Auto-post never runs | Mapping exists, `auto_post` enabled, stock in `fin_good` |
| Push fails with offer_id error | Paste the Inventory offer ID from eBay into the mapping |
| Credentials vanish after restore | Expected: re-enter them or set env vars |

## Limits (eBay)

- `getOrders` history window: up to two years; default lookback when no watermark is seven days.
- `bulkUpdatePriceQuantity`: one product SKU per call, max 25 offers.
- Rate limits: client retries 429/5xx with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s).
