# ERP inside CoMa

Acres ERP functionality runs entirely inside CoMa: Express (`/api/erp`) + React CoMa UI (`/erp/*`) + the same SQLite file as shopfloor. There is no Python process, no second server, and no Acres HTML skin.

Runtime is Node only: `server/erp/`.

## Two processes only

| Process | Role |
|---|---|
| Express (`PORT`, default 3000) | Shopfloor APIs + full `/api/erp/*` + production SPA |
| Vite (`VITE_PORT`, default 5173, dev only) | React hot reload; proxies `/api` to Express |

Production: one process (`node server/index.js` serving `client/dist`).

## Modules (API + UI)

| Module | API | React route |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard (KPIs + sync + needs data + pending postings) | `/api/erp/dashboard`, `POST /sync` | `/erp` |
| Shopfloor postings queue | `/postings`, `/postings/:id/confirm`, `/postings/:id/dismiss` | `/erp/postings` |
| Analytics (profitability, OEE, cost variance) | `/reports/profitability`, `/reports/machine-oee`, `/reports/cost-variance` | `/erp/analytics` |
| Products & components | `/items` (`item_role`, `sourcing`) | `/erp/items` |
| Warehouses + locations | `/warehouses`, `/locations` | `/erp/locations` |
| Inventory receive + stock + charts | `/inventory/*` | `/erp/inventory` |
| Manufacturing dashboard | dashboard + shared machines + open WOs | `/erp/manufacturing` |
| Machine rates (printer-linked) | `/mfg/machines` | `/erp/machines` (manual USD/h or calculated: maintenance + kW × USD/kWh; linked printer fields) |
| Manufacturing components + cost estimate | `/mfg/components`, `/mfg/calculate-component-cost` | `/erp/components` |
| BOM (lines, cost with WAC/MFG fallback, delete) | `/bom/*` | `/erp/bom` |
| Work orders + complete (UOM-aware issues) | `/wo/*` | `/erp/wo`, `/erp/qr` |
| Sales dashboard | reports + stock summary | `/erp/sales` |
| Sales config / pricing / reset | `/sales/config`, `/sales/pricing`, `/sales/pricing/:id/reset` | `/erp/sales/*` |
| Sales orders + history CSV/PDF | `/sales/order/items`, `/sales/orders`, `/sales/orders/report` | `/erp/sales/order`, `/erp/sales/reports` |
| Customers | `/customers` | `/erp/customers` |
| Sales documents: Quote / Delivery note / Invoice | `/sales-docs/*` | `/erp/quotes`, `/erp/delivery-notes`, `/erp/invoices`, `/erp/sales-docs/:id` |
| Orders Hub (marketplace channels) | `/api/erp/channels` | `/erp/orders-hub` |
| eBay Sell (orders, inventory push, analytics) | `/api/erp/ebay/*` | `/erp/orders-hub/ebay` (legacy `/erp/ebay`) |
| Shopify Admin (orders, inventory push) | `/api/erp/shopify/*` | `/erp/orders-hub/shopify` |

Navigation lives in the CoMa sidebar only (Dashboard, Inventory, Manufacturing, Sales modules). ERP pages use `ErpShell` for the page title; there is no second in-page module nav.

## Acres parity audit

The standalone Acres Python/HTML tree was removed from this repository once parity landed in CoMa. Behavior below is what CoMa implements in Express + React.

| Reference capability | Status | CoMa implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Health and UI config | IMPLEMENTED | `/api/erp/health`, `/api/erp/config/ui` (decimals_display drives Mfg Components qty format) |
| Item, UOM, warehouse, and location masters | IMPLEMENTED | Express CRUD/list routes plus `/erp/items` and `/erp/locations` (warehouse + consumption/purchase UOM columns) |
| Inventory receipt, WAC, snapshot, warehouse charts | IMPLEMENTED | `/inventory/*`; value-by-warehouse donut/bars and per-warehouse dual qty/value charts; on-hand total footer |
| Machine rates and component cost estimate | IMPLEMENTED | `/mfg/machines`, `/mfg/components`, `/mfg/calculate-component-cost` (Mat $/unit and Time $/unit columns; scrap applied in CoMa cost estimate) |
| BOM create/update, inline qty, cost footer, estimate* | IMPLEMENTED | `/bom/*`; React supports product+BOM creation, inline qty edit, three-line cost footer, `*` when unit cost falls back to MFG recipe |
| WO create/list/get, shortage check, UOM issue, labor, destination receipt | IMPLEMENTED | `/wo/*`; warehouse + name columns; `q` filtered in SQL before LIMIT |
| Pick list and QR completion | IMPLEMENTED | Local QR for `/erp/qr?wo=ID` |
| Sales config / pricing / reports / orders | IMPLEMENTED | Margin badges, header-click sort, Enter/Escape pricing edits, live sales-order totals |
| Manufacturing and sales dashboards | IMPLEMENTED | Native CoMa dashboards at `/erp/manufacturing` and `/erp/sales` (Acres left these unfinished) |
| Shopfloor to ERP stock bridge | IMPLEMENTED | Operator-confirmed posting queue (see below) |

Deliberate CoMa improvement vs Acres: `POST /mfg/calculate-component-cost` multiplies material by `(1 + scrap_pct/100)`. Acres ignored scrap on that estimate endpoint.

## Shopfloor compatibility

| Shopfloor | ERP |
|---|---|
| Project | Product (`item_role=product`) |
| Part (pieza) | Component (`item_role=component`) |
| Printer | Machine (`machine.printer_id`) |
| Filament type/color | Raw material (`item_role=raw`, sourcing outsource) |

Every product/component has sourcing: **manufactured** or **outsource**. Sync creates stubs; operators complete ERP-only fields (rates, sourcing confirmation, receive costs). Creating a project or part from shopfloor also syncs and accepts optional `sourcing`.

Machine rows created from printers stay in Dashboard `Needs ERP data` until their hourly rate is greater than zero. Filament raw-material reminders survive later syncs until stock is received, then remain resolved. Both historical `filament_colors.hex` and current `hex_color` databases are supported.

## Shopfloor posting queue (operator-confirmed)

Set Ready (and `POST /api/bridge/units-completed`) create a pending row in `erp_posting` keyed by `job_id` (unique, survives restarts). **No path in this queue changes `parts.completed_qty`.**

1. Operator confirms quality on the printer (Set Ready) as today.
2. CoMa enqueues `erp_posting` with qty, linked `erp_sku`, and a snapshot of job telemetry (`actual_minutes`, `actual_grams`, `actual_energy_kwh`, `telemetry_quality`).
3. Operator opens `/erp/postings` and confirms. That consumes raw (via `mfg_component` recipe when present) and receives the component into the `comp` warehouse inside a transaction. When `telemetry_quality` is `measured`, receive `unit_cost` uses actual machine time / material / energy; otherwise the standard recipe cost is used. Preview shows both.
4. If stock is short, the API returns 409 with `acknowledge_required`. The plastic was already used on the printer, so the operator may confirm with `acknowledge_shortage: true` (qty_on_hand may go negative). Dismiss abandons the posting without stock moves.

Double confirm of a posted row returns 409. Stock moves use `idem_key` values derived from the posting id.

Analytics at `/erp/analytics` (and `GET /api/erp/reports/*`) cross telemetried jobs with costing and sales: cost variance vs standards, project profitability including failed-job waste, and machine OEE from `printer_status_history`.

Gap left from the original Acres design (not implemented in CoMa): purchase orders / vendors. Raw material WAC still enters via Inventory receive.

## Sales documents: Quote / Delivery note / Invoice

A second, customer-facing sales flow next to the plain Sales Order above: `Customer` master data plus a convertible document chain, **Quote** to **Delivery note** to **Invoice** (document numbers still use `PRE-` / `ALB-` / `FAC-` prefixes). Scope is deliberately "simple docs": sequential numbering per type (`PRE-000001`, `ALB-000001`, `FAC-000001`), a per-line tax rate (defaults to 21%, editable), and hand-rolled PDF export. There is no VeriFactu/SII wiring and no legal no-gaps numbering guarantee; that would need Joel's sign-off before being built.

Tables: `customer`, `sales_doc`, `sales_doc_line`, `doc_counter` (see [docs/database.md](../database.md)). Business logic in `server/erp/salesDocs.js`, routes in `server/erp/index.js` under `/api/erp/customers` and `/api/erp/sales-docs`.

Lifecycle:
1. Create a document (`POST /sales-docs`) with a customer and at least one line. It starts as `draft` and can be freely edited (`PUT /sales-docs/:id`) or deleted by cancelling.
2. Confirm it (`POST /sales-docs/:id/confirm`). Confirmed documents can no longer be edited.
3. Convert a confirmed document one step down the chain (`POST /sales-docs/:id/convert { "to": "delivery" }` or `"invoice"`). This copies the lines into a brand-new draft document and stamps `source_doc_id` for traceability. A document can be converted more than once (partial delivery, partial invoicing).
4. Download a PDF at any time (`GET /sales-docs/:id/pdf`).

**Shopfloor sync:** a confirmed (`posted`) row in the `erp_posting` queue (see above) can become a delivery-note line via `POST /postings/:id/attach-to-delivery`, either appended to an existing draft delivery note (`doc_id`) or as a brand-new one for a chosen customer (`customer_id`). The line carries `job_id`/`posting_id` for traceability back to the printer job. This is purely a billing convenience: it never touches `parts.completed_qty` or re-runs any stock move already applied by the posting confirm. The Postings page (`/erp/postings`) exposes this as a "Create delivery note" action on posted rows.

**Settings:** `sales_doc_mode` (`legacy` or `quotes_flow`, Settings > General) picks which sales flow is the default landing point. Both flows always stay available in the sidebar and share no exclusive data; switching the setting never deletes or hides existing documents. It is asked once during the first-run onboarding wizard (`client/src/components/AuthGate.jsx`) and can be changed later.

## Importing an original Acres database

The standalone Acres Python/HTML tree was removed from this repository (see the "Acres
parity audit" above), but an operator who ran that Acres instance for real can still bring
its data across. Acres shared the exact same table and column names CoMa still creates in
`server/erp/schema.js` (`uom`, `warehouse`, `location`, `item`, `machine`, `bom`, `bom_line`,
`mfg_component`, `work_order`, `wo_issue`, `wo_labor`, `stock_move`, `item_cost`,
`pricing_config`, `sales_order`), so `server/erp/importAcres.js` merges an Acres `.db` file
into the live CoMa database over `POST /api/erp/import-acres` (Settings > Backup >
"Import original Acres database"), or by calling `importAcresDatabase(db, path)` directly
from a script.

This is a merge, not a replace:

- Every table is matched by natural key first, so importing into a database that already
  has seeded defaults (the `EA`/`KG`/`G` UOMs, `comp`/`fin_good`/`raw` warehouses, the four
  `pricing_config` rows, the `LABOR` machine) or shopfloor-synced stubs (see "Shopfloor
  compatibility" above) never duplicates them. Natural keys: `uom.code`, `warehouse.code`,
  `item.sku`, `machine.machine`, `mfg_component.sku`, `pricing_config.code`,
  `work_order.code` (when set).
- Every foreign key (`warehouse_id`, `item_id`, `raw_item_id`, `component_item_id`,
  `bom_id`, `location_id`, `wo_id`, `parent_wo_id`, ...) is rewritten from the source
  file's ids to this database's ids while walking tables in dependency order, since a
  fresh CoMa install's autoincrement ids never line up with an old Acres file's ids.
- `pricing_config` and `item_cost` rows that already exist are left untouched by default:
  the import never silently changes a margin/fee the operator already configured or a
  stock quantity/WAC already tracked here. Pass `overwrite_pricing_config` /
  `overwrite_item_cost` (checkboxes in Settings, or form fields on the API) to update them
  from the source file instead.
- `work_order` matches by `code` when the source row has one; a matched work order's
  `wo_issue`/`wo_labor` children are not re-imported (they were already brought over the
  first time). `stock_move` and `sales_order` have no natural key, so they dedupe by
  matching every other column, keeping re-imports of the same source file idempotent.
- Nothing shopfloor-side (`printers`, `projects`, `parts`, `jobs`) and never
  `parts.completed_qty`. CoMa-only additions Acres never had (`customer`, `sales_doc`,
  `sales_doc_line`, `doc_counter`, `erp_posting`, `ebay_*`) are simply absent from an Acres
  file and are left alone.
- The whole import runs inside one transaction: any failure rolls back completely, so a
  partially-merged database is never left behind.

API contract: [docs/api.md](../api.md) `POST /api/erp/import-acres`. Automated coverage:
`server/tests/erp-import-acres.test.js`.

## Single database

Shopfloor and ERP tables share `server/data/{organic|seed}-data.db`. Schema is additive only.

The Settings JSON backup includes the complete shared domain: shopfloor, uploaded G-code, ERP masters, inventory, costing, BOMs, work orders, pricing, sales, and `erp_posting`. Restore validates that the ERP section is complete before changing data. Legacy shopfloor-only backups preserve the ERP records already in the target database.

## Shared masters

- Machines: `machine` + `printers` via `GET /api/shared/machines`
- Materials: `item` via `GET /api/shared/materials`
- Parts link with nullable `parts.erp_sku`

## Ops

```bash
./start.sh    # Express + Vite only (ERP included)
./stop.sh
```

Development runtime is Node only. `start.sh` uses Linux `setsid` to manage the Express+Vite process group. Python can be installed as a build tool for native npm modules, but no Python process runs CoMa or the ERP.

## Verified E2E flow

Use the seed dataset so organic operator data is untouched:

```bash
./start.sh --seed-data --with-simulator
```

Open `/erp`, then run this workflow:

1. Sync shopfloor from Dashboard.
2. Receive a raw SKU in Inventory (charts update).
3. Define a machine rate and manufacturing component.
4. Create a product+BOM and add the component line.
5. Create and complete a WO. Confirm the inventory warning because completion issues raw/component stock and receives finished stock.
6. Place a sales order. Confirm the warning because the sale depletes finished stock.
7. Open Sales Reports, filter the history, and download CSV/PDF.
8. After Set Ready on the Virtual Klipper (or any held printer), open `/erp/postings` and confirm the pending row.

Automated coverage: `server/tests/erp-embedded.test.js` and `server/tests/erp-postings.test.js`.
